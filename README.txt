'Healed within 5 Days'

My son had a bad snowboard accident where he hit a rock with his face. Fortunately, he had only a bruise under the eye and the nose, but deep scrapes all over his face and he had an appointment on Monday for a new job!! So, he applied X39™ on his body for 3 days and just have a look at how quickly and perfectly his skin healed, there isn’t even a trace of a scar on his cheek within 5 days.

'The doctor said she was amazed at how quickly I was healing'

I had an accident which caused a deep laceration on my left shin. It required 10 stitches on the outside and 2 on the inside. The doctor said “your one lucky dude you just missed the nerve by a hair.” It was about a 3-inch laceration and I could visually see my shin bone. Yes, not for the faint of heart. I used X39™ near the area and as illustrated in the instruction for use. In the second picture which was just 4 days after the accident, you can see very little swelling and redness reduced. One of the things that I noticed was that I had a severe reduction in aches and discomfort around the area. Even the swelling was minimal. On day 8 I was hopeful I could get the stitches out. The doctor said she was amazed at how quickly I was healing and how good the wound looked. The stiches were removed, and the doctor released me and said I was good to surf and resume normal activity the next day! I am so impressed at my progress and how incredibly fast it healed.
'Incredible results after 3 months'

After 18 years of multiple breaks, this members’ thumb was inflamed and blue in colour. Using the X39™ patch for 3 months, there is a dramatic difference – just incredible!
'My Skin Looks Much Younger and Healthier'

I have noticed after I have been using X39 for 2-3 weeks my skin looks much younger, healthier and shines 24/7 with or without make up. I am so excited, thank you for this discovery!

'My skin responds positively to it'

I started using it 10 days ago and already see that my skin responds positively to it. Tighter skin on my throat, my hairdresser commented today that I have received a lot of small hairs throughout the scalp... new that's new. I also notice that I sleep deeper and have more energy throughout the day.

'Increased Skin Suppleness'

In my twenties I spent a lot of time in the sun and the front of my lower thighs have had rougher skin as a result. I don’t think I am imagining this, but I have started to notice the skin is becoming more elastic and smooth. It feels like the right amount of oil is in my skin. It is hard to describe. I can even see in my forearms the skin elasticity has increased and skin on my hands appears more supple.

'The pain finally went away with the X39™'

I’ve been in Europe on a biking tour (270 miles) from Prague to Budapest. Just got back last week. I have had lower back/hip issues since last Thanksgiving and have had adjustments to prolozone injections which helped improve up to 60%. The lingering pain finally went away adding the X-39 patch within two weeks. I was concerned how my back was going to get during the biking trip and it didn’t bother me at all other than tightness. It was one of our favourite trips. So I was really happy I didn’t have back/hip issues.

'The effect is almost a miracle!'

I hurt my lower back which also caused pain in one leg. It’s the most painful experience I’ve ever had. For the past several months I’ve had cortisone injections and physical therapy which have helped somewhat although I still was unable to walk normally. As soon as I started using the X39™ the pain went down almost immediately, and I was able to walk again without limping. I don’t want to exaggerate but the effect is almost a miracle!

'Yea David! I think that this is your best yet'

I placed the X39 on the back of my neck I usually walk in the morning - about 2 miles. When I return home, I’m always tired and have a lot of hip and foot pain. That morning I started walking - and I kept walking without even thinking about it. When I got back home (4 miles later), I felt great and had no pain. WHAT! The last three months I’ve had almost constant heel pain from plantar fasciitis. I sleep with a boot that is designed to hold my foot in the correct position, special socks in the daytime to work with it, and nothing has stopped the pain. I went to a podiatrist, and his only solution was cortisone injections, and if those don’t work, surgery to cut the tendon. The pain was getting so severe that I was considering it. I put the X39 on my heel - absolutely no more pain. Unheard of! I’m beyond excited. I can’t wait to see what we experience after several months of using this patch. Yea David!!! I think that this is your best yet.

'More energy and natural day rhythm'

After 7 days with X39™: Feeling a lot of energy. I never run. I don’t like running. Suddenly I feel an urge to run 2-3 kilometres (to me that’s really a long run) in the middle of my summer vacation and jump into the sea and swim afterwards. That never happened before. Furthermore, my day rhythm has changed. I’m much more awake and clear during the day and I fall asleep immediately at night. It’s a huge change to me. I’m very excited about the future with X39™.

'I feel more focused, energetic and youthful'

Having had back pain for over 20 years and using cortisone shots with osteoporosis side effects, I got introduced to LifeWave in June 2017. LifeWave changed my life towards a healthy and wealthy life. No more back pain or any other type of problems. I was very happy with the LifeWave patches before I got introduced to the X39™. After 1 week I feel more focused, energetic and youthful using it.

In regard to the X39™, I have noticed a significant change in my overall energy level, endurance, sleeping more soundly, mental clarity, skin tone, my hair volume and overall sense of well-being and really love the product! Thank you so much.

'It gives me more energy and I feel stronger'

I was excited about this new patch. I am testing it for one week now and I feel that I have more energy doing my daily workout. I can do more repetitions and I am not so exhausted afterwards. It gives me more energy and I feel stronger.

'Within 5 minutes my muscle soreness went away'

I called my trainer at 8am and told her I wouldn’t be coming in to work out. I was tired, my legs hurt, and wasn’t feeling so well. At 8:15am, I put on the X39, and within 5 minutes my muscle soreness went away. I called her and told her I was going to go to the gym at 11am! I went to the gym and we did AN HOUR leg day training. I didn’t burn out at all. I did extra reps, without stopping - on exercises I usually can’t even do. After my workout, I did 25 minutes of cardio like it was NOTHING. I told her I was wearing a patch, so she pushed me extra hard. It didn’t feel like I had a hardcore work out - I felt like I had just finished a 3-block walk. The next day I woke up with NO soreness in my legs!

'My shoulder was all the way back to normal'

I’m a former National Bodybuilder Champion since 1985 and competed in 14 Bodybuilding contests and WON 7 ... 1st. place trophies, including West Coast Nationals Bodybuilding Championship that was played on ESPN. I’m 52 now and soon to get married, so I wanted to get back in shape fast, but haven’t been in the gym seriously for many years. I decided to go to the gym with my older brother Tony and we first warmed up with the life cycle and went straight to the bench press and I went to heavy too fast and my left shoulder dropped, and I tore my tendon. I never tore a tendon before, that was VERY PAINFUL. My level of pain from 0 to 10... it was 15 I was sweating because I was in so much PAIN. I was told a torn tendon will take over a year to heal with physical therapy and even possibly surgery. I didn’t want to do either of those, so I went home and applied X39™ on the point of pain and immediately the pain started to subside. I was so EXCITED!!! I used X39™ everyday... just a little over 3 months, and my left shoulder was ALL the way BACK to normal and I CAN workout AGAIN!!! I might of had a little setback, but know I have a BIG come BACK THANKS to X39™ how do you explain that it a MIRACLE!

'I don't feel like I need to wait 2 days to recover'

Since I first used the X39™ patches 6 days ago I am blown away with the results! I work out with weights at the gym 3 days a week and I normally experience pain, inflammation and tiredness for a couple of days. With X39™ I am able to work out harder and my muscles feel like they are healing in real time! I don't feel like I need to wait 2 days to recover between workouts anymore!

'This is very fast and unreal recovery'

Several years ago, I went on skiing in Austria. I had an accident, and the ligaments in my left knee were injured. I could barely walk because my knee hurt and was totally unstable. During the first 24 hours my knee swelled up, my leg was put in a plaster cast for six weeks and I had to use painkillers 6 days ago I went to the gym to join a "Power Well" class - 30 minutes of quite hard work out. Suddenly at one jump I feel this twist inside my left knee, it hurts badly, and I fall down on the floor. Boom - same as in Austria 20 years ago. A physiotherapist at the gym examines the knee - it's the ligaments again, knee unstable, rest, ice, compression, elevation. And of course, patches after I got home. So, this is what I did until now and what happened:

Day 1 (Saturday): Aeon on the top of the knee, IceWave on ST 36 on both sides, Carnosine on the left side of the knee and Glutathione on the right side. And on top of the knee just above the Aeon: X-39. Knee: No swelling at all. Pain reduced from 9 - 3. No medical painkillers necessary.
Day 2: Same placement of patches. Knee: No swelling. I can bend my knee 90 degrees. I can walk carefully, and I hobble. I can walk on stairs one step at a time. Pain reduced to 2.
Day 3: Same placement of patches. Knee: Pain reduced to 1. I still have to walk carefully but I no longer hobble. I can walk slowly up the stairs, still one step at a time down the stairs. In the morning I can bend my leg like 70-80 degrees. I put the X-39 on the back on my knee. At night I can bend by knee carefully to 45 degrees.
Day 4-7: I used X39™ every day, but now in the neck. Pain stays on 1, but it only hurts if I bend the knee too much.
Yesterday (day 6) I can walk down the stairs. no bandage necessary. This is very fast and unreal recovery. I can feel that I have to be careful, but I can walk, I can walk on stairs, I've been working, and I feel it's getting better every day.

'This is really life changing for me'

I think I can honestly say that I’ve experienced DEEP sleep since the first day. Last Sunday night I slept for 9.5 hrs. I cannot emphasize enough how incredible this was. And it was 7 hrs straight - then woke up for about 5 min and went back to sleep for 2.5 more hours!!! Every night seems to be a solid 7 hrs. I have been struggling with sleep issues pretty consistently for a good 2-3 years - and, honestly, I’ve been feeling a little desperate about that in the past month or so. This is really life changing for me.

'My Sleep has improved'

My sleep pattern has improved. Normally I am very restless and don’t sleep through the night but am I happy to say that has improved dramatically.

'I enjoy a deep sleep of 7-8 hours'

At night I fall asleep right away. Currently I enjoy a deep sleep of 7-8 hours, without any interruptions.

'I was able to sleep without sleeping pills'

I had been feeling so weak, no appetite and can’t sleep. After few days of using the patches I noticed I got back my energy, got my appetite and I was able to sleep without the sleeping pills.
